Using the following job description and CV, write a tailored, professional cover letter in English.

Job Description:
${jobDescription}

CV:
${cvText}

Personal Information (use this for the letter header):
- Name: ${personalInfo.firstName} ${personalInfo.lastName}
- Email: ${personalInfo.email}
- Phone: ${personalInfo.phone}
- Address: ${personalInfo.address}

CRITICAL LENGTH CONSTRAINT: The cover letter MUST fit on a single A4 page. The header (name, contact info, date) will take approximately 40% of the page. You have only about 400-500 words maximum for the main content.

MOST IMPORTANT GUIDELINES: Don't use any * or ** or - or --

The cover letter should be:
- Formal yet engaging
- Highlight most relevant experiences and skills matching the job description
- Clear structure: introduction, motivation, skills alignment, strong closing
- Confident, enthusiastic tone adapted to the company

Write the cover letter content (without the header information, as it will be added to the PDF separately). Keep it brief - aim for 300-400 words maximum.`;
